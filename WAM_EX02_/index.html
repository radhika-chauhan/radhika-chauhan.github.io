            Today our two-dimensional world is saturated with linear perspective,
            whether in photographs, on television, or, indeed, in much of art.
            Yet linear perspective is an invention rooted solely in the Western
            classical tradition.1 Why did artists in the Near East, the Far East,
            Africa, and the Americas not come up with linear perspective on their
            own? Among the reasons is the Greeks’ conception of geometry not
            as rules-of-thumb, but as a logical system of proofs. They also had
            the unusual desire to imitate reality in their art. I am not going to
            discuss those issues here. Instead I focus on one of the less obvious
            reasons: linear perspective is an impoverished system for representing
            information within a single frame.2
        <br><br>
            Egyptian art furnishes a prime example of what an artist can achieve
            without linear perspective. Consider the painted relief of the office
            of the vizier under Meneptah, the son of Ramses II, ca. 1232 B.C.E.
            (figure 1).3 The rectangle is divided into three vertical sections of
            unequal widths that decrease from left to right. Only the center is not
            subdivided. It is devoted to the vizier, on the left, performing a sacrifice
            to Thoth with the help of a priest, on the right. The vizier takes up
            over two-thirds of the height and nearly half the width of his rectangle, 
            while the priest is slim and does not even reach the vizier’s waist.
            In other words, hierarchical perspective tells us which figure is more
            important. On the left are three rows of men hard at work. The top and
            bottom registers have five scribes each, seated to the right and writing
            on papyrus draped across their laps. The middle row has a larger
            figure, seated to the left, about to sign a document being submitted to
            him by the figure standing in front of him. That figure is accompanied
            by two lesser ones. Behind the seated figure is a small servant with a
            fan. On the far right are three rooms, again divided into three unequal
            horizontal sections. The top and bottom ones show storage boxes
            for documents, seen in a bird’s-eye view, while the middle and larger
            room contains the god Thoth in the form of a baboon, seen in “normal”
            orthogonal perspective like all the other figures.

            What makes this scene remarkable to someone accustomed to linear
            perspective becomes apparent only on closer examination, for the entire
            set of scenes is placed within a floor plan much like those we are accustomed 
            to (figure 2). The building, like the division of functions, is divided
            into three sections. On the left the scribes are disposed in the three
            areas formed by the two rows of columns. The central section has four
            rows of five columns apiece that set this space off from the three rooms
            on the right. Nor did the artist stop with the basic ground plan. He also
            included all the entrances to the rooms, and by their size and placement
            indicated which were main doors and which were subsidiary ones. Two
            imposing entries—the one on the left of the middle vertical section and
            the one to Thoth’s room—are both shown vertically, while the others
            are oriented horizontally and take up less room. Thoth’s room is further
            guarded by two smaller Thoths on either side of the entrance.
        <br><br>
            Now try a thought experiment. Imagine this scene depicted in linear
            perspective. Whoops! We see nothing, because the exterior wall of the
            building blocks our view of the interior. Let us try again and omit the
            exterior wall. On the left, we see a line of five scribes, but not the two
            rows behind them whose view is blocked. Hence, the most significant
            action of this section—the signing of the document—is omitted.
            If, however, we raise the horizon line, the second row will appear, but
            its smaller size will de-emphasize its importance. Next, in the central
            vertical section, we see the vizier making a sacrifice and learn, perhaps,
            that he is physically shorter than the priest on the right, who, as taller,
            may be more important. Finally, on the right, one row of storage boxes
            can be seen. We have no idea what the layout of the building is like
            or precisely where the figures are within that building. In other words,
            linear perspective must ignore a large amount of information in order
            to preserve one kind of information alone, the physical aspects of the
            setting and its elements. In fact, to portray all the information contained
            within that single frame, a proponent of linear perspective would need
            at least ten drawings: a ground plan, four elevations for the entrances,
            and five pictures for the figures (three for the scribes, one for the
            central scene, and one of Thoth). Captions would help identify who
            is who and their relative importance.

            As the Egyptian example demonstrates, linear perspective affects
            the amount of information portrayed. Roman art combines both the
            Egyptian system and linear perspective within the same frame in a
            manner that often jars our modern eyes with its seeming inconsistencies. For example, a lustratio on the Column of Trajan shows a typical
            suovetaurilia, with the victimarii on the left and the three animals being
            led in a single line in the usual orthogonal perspective along the outside
            of a walled camp (figure 3).5 This part of the scene is reminiscent of
            earlier animal sacrifices of three animals, such as the one with two cows
            and a sheep on the altar of the Ara Pacis.6 Yet on the far right, also
            outside the wall, are more figures, whose heads are the same size,
            even though they are farther away and are depicted above the wall.
            The head of the procession of animals turns through a gateway into
            the interior of the camp, where Trajan appears slightly larger than the
            figures surrounding him. At this point the visual problems become more
            obvious than they were for the figures on the far right outside the wall,
            who are actually around a turn of the column and therefore almost in a
            separate scene. For someone accustomed to strict linear perspective,
            Trajan and his group appear to tower above the walls, which in turn
            are only slightly higher than the figures outside—visually possible if
            the camp is on higher ground, but then Trajan and his men should be
            smaller than the figures outside the wall, not larger, as they clearly are.
            At the same time the group within the camp, like those outside it, are
            depicted in orthogonal perspective. Only the building is depicted in linear
            perspective, with a corner jutting out just above the middle of the bull’s
            head; and the view is not, as the viewer might expect from the figures
            walking in a line outside it, looking up at the camp, but rather looking
            down in a semi-bird’s-eye view on the scene within it. Even more
            visually confusing, the figures within the walls are depicted in orthogonal
            perspective like those outside the walls. Thus the scene is composed
            of elements that taken separately make visual sense, but not as a
            whole.
