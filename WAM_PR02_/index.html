         &#8220;The contemporary compulsion to produce robs things of their endurance ... 
        <br>  it intentionally erodes duration in order to increase production, to force
        <br>  more consumption. Lingering, however, presupposes things that endure.
        <br>  If things are merely used up and consumed, there can be no lingering.  
        <br>  And the same compulsion of production destabilizes life by undermining
        <br>  what is enduring in life. Thus, despite the fact that life expectancy  
        <br>  is increasing, production is destroying life’s endurance.&#8221;
        <br>  <i>— Byung-Chul Han</i>
        <br>
        
        <br>To really map productivity it is important to know that the idea 
        <br>of constant production or consumption is capitalist in nature. 
        <br>The more we produce, the more value is generated and that benfits 
        <br>capitalist forces to continue extracting value and goods.
        <br>Our compulsion to always be "on" and keep producing comes from 
        <br>the need to satisfy these forces and in the process leads to 
        <br>loss of endurance and lingering in life. 
        <br>

        <br><i>Stephanie Choi </i> looks to Jonathan Crary, who maps the demonisation 
        <br>of sleep throughout Western thought; &#8220; within capitalism, the  sleep
        <br> is the realm of human experience that cannot be monetized towards
        <br> production or consumption. Sleep, then, can be seen as a form of
        <br> resistance to 24/7 capitalism — our era in which globalisation  
        <br>necessitates continual access to both our attention and our working day&#8221;
        <br>

        <br> In this project, I map my productivity through this lens and broaden my own 
        <br> understanding of what I consider productive in my life as part of everyday.
        <br> The moments of <i>linger</i> and <i>sleep</i> became central to this plotting as all 
        <br> time not spent actively working is not <i>not productive.</i>
